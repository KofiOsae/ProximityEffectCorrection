- **Upload CSV or XLSX Data**: Requires `Dose`, `PatternDensity`, `Target CD`, `Centre` columns.
- **Interactive Plotting**:
  - 3D Polynomial Surface
  - 2D Contour Plot
  - Isofocal Dose Trends (with Linear, Quadratic, and Double-Gaussian Fits)
  - CD Contour Maps from Double-Gaussian
  - Double-Gaussian PSF Plot
  - Mean & Std Dev of CD vs Target CD

## 🔍 Process Optimization Tools

### ✅ Isofocal Fit Confidence Intervals
For both linear and quadratic fits, the app overlays **±95% confidence bands**, allowing users to:

- Visually assess model uncertainty.
- Evaluate robustness across pattern densities.

### ✅ Bias Estimation
Bias is estimated at the dose predicted to achieve the target CD for both linear and quadratic fits, using the full 2D polynomial model.
